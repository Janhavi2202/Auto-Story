                      The H’ness CB 350 has stepped into the rapidly growing retro genre of bikes which comprises of the Royal Enfield Classic 350, Jawa Standard, and the Benelli Imperiale 400. Honda has bestowed it with a design heavily inspired by the larger CB 1100 EX. It gets a round headlamp, a curvy fuel tank, a leather tan seat, chopped fenders, and a chrome-finished exhaust. Meanwhile, the presence of blacked-out components and alloy wheels also lend it a modern appeal.
                      
                      Although it follows a retro cosmetic theme, the feature list is a sheer contrast and comprises of modern bits.

                      The new Hornet 2.0 replaces the CB Hornet 160R which used to be Honda’s one of the highest selling motorcycles. The Hornet brand was known for its aggressive styling and good performance. The new Hornet 2.0 plans to take that to a new level.
                      
                      The Hornet 2.0 retains the design language of the CB Hornet 160R. But now, it gets cleaner lines and has more bulk that makes it quite striking. Plus, with the presence of golden upside down forks, this Honda looks quite premium. There are other premium bits like LCD instrument cluster, LED lighting and also some practical features like hazard switch.
                      
                      The Hornet 2.0 uses an 184cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled, fuel-injected motor that produces 16.1Nm of peak torque. This motor is mated to a five-speed gearbox.

                      The Honda Grazia is to the Dio what the Activa 125 is to the regular Activa. It occupies a space alongside the Activa 125 that caters to the younger generation. The focus of the scooter is on generating more excitement rather than focusing on practicality. As such, it gets aggressive styling with ‘motoscooter’ looks which got sharper and edgier with the BS6 update.
                      
                      The Grazia comes equipped with a host of features like LED headlamps and a twin digital instrument cluster that also includes a feature we haven’t seen on a scooter since the Kinetic Blaze – a tachometer! During the BS6 update, this console was tweaked to show additional data such as real-time fuel efficiency, distance-to-empty and more. There are other convenience-oriented features too including a side-stand indicator with engine cut-off, external fuel filler and an idling stop system, which is exclusive to the Deluxe trim.
                      
                      It is powered by the same single-cylinder, fuel-injected engine that powers the Activa 125. In base form it incorporates drum brakes, but opt for the Deluxe variant, and you get a front disc brake. It rides on 12-inch and 10-inch alloy wheels at the front and rear, respectively. Suspension duties are handled by telescopic forks and a monoshock.
                      
                      It is available in yellow, grey, blue and red. Honda also offers it in Sports Edition which comes in two swanky colour options including Pearl Nightstar Black and Sports Red. In terms of competition, the Honda Grazia goes up against the Hero Maestro Edge, Yamaha Ray ZR, TVS Ntorq 125, Aprilia SR 125 and Suzuki Burgman Street 125.</p>

It is available in 2 variants and 6 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 1,20,000. Bajaj Chetak generates 3800 W power from its motor. With front disc and rear drum brakes, Bajaj Chetak comes up with combined braking system of both wheels.

                      Before Bajaj Auto became popular for its modern range of motorcycles, it was principally known for its two-wheeler scooter, namely the Bajaj Chetak. Over the past few years, the Pune-based two-wheeler giant had completely stopped manufacturing scooters and since then it has been working on a new electric scooter offering and has now finally launched the Chetak, in an electric avatar.

                      As the name suggests, the scooter harks back to its roots by taking design cues from the iconic Chetak and giving it a contemporary and fresh look. It uses sheet metal body panels that offer a premium touch, while the smooth flowing lines, LED lighting and turn signals with sequential blinking similar to high-end cars add to its modernity. Furthermore, it packs fully-digital Bluetooth-enabled instrumentation that comes with a host of features.

                      As far as the powertrain is concerned, the Bajaj Chetak is equipped with an electric motor that draws its power from a 3kWh IP67 rated lithium-ion battery. The power rating of its motor is 4kW (peak) and 3.8kW (continuous) with 16Nm of peak torque. The powertrain comes with two drive modes — Sport and Eco, which are capable of returning a range of 95km and 85km, respectively. Bajaj claims that the battery will last for about 70,000km before a replacement is needed. Besides that, Bajaj has equipped the e-scooter with several innovative features like a reverse assist mode, regenerative braking and an onboard Intelligent Battery Management System (IBMS) to control charge and discharge seamlessly.

Plus, the round headlamp, the bulky fuel tank, the big side covers and the spoke wheels set the Classic 350 apart. Also, there’re some aftermarket accessories that the company is offering with this bike.

The new colour options are accompanied by the existing options – Rock Red, Lake Blue, and Gravel Grey. Meanwhile, the company has discontinued the Snow and Sleet Grey paint options from the list.
                      
                      The 2021 model also benefits from Royal Enfield’s Tripper Navigation system. The navigation system is powered by Google Maps and it works with the Royal Enfield smartphone application to give turn-by-turn directions. The semi-digital instrument cluster, on the other hand, remains similar to the previous model. Other changes include revisions to the seat, the rear carrier, the front rack, and an updated design for the windscreen to further enhance the motorcycle’s touring capabilities.

                      Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 is a cruiser bike available at a starting price of Rs. 2,70,510 in India. It is available in 3 variants and 7 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 2,91,923. The Interceptor 650 is powered by 648cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 47 bhp and a torque of 52 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Interceptor 650 bike weighs 202 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.7 liters.

                      The Interceptor is one of the two models based on the 650cc twin cylinder platform from Royal Enfield. It is more ‘street bike’ of the two, and has the wider appeal with its retro looks and comfort and the capability to carry a pillion rider as well.
                      
                      The Interceptor has, at its heart, a BS6-compliant, fuel-injected 648cc parallel twin air/oil cooled motor that generates 46.8bhp and 52Nm. It feeds the rear wheel via a six-speed gearbox and chain drive. The chassis, brakes and suspension are all modern-feeling, with all the charm that their retro looks offer. The brakes are single discs at both ends, with a 320mm disc at the front, and a 240mm disc at the rear. ABS is standard. The suspension has conventional forks at the front and twin gas-charged shock absorbers at the rear, with preload adjustment. The tyres are technically tubeless but require a tube inside as the spoked 18-inch rims are not airtight.

				<h1>YAMAHA</h1>

		    <h3> Rs. 73.00 - 78.00 Thousands* </h3>
                    <p> 
                      Yamaha Fascino 125 is a scooter available at a starting price of Rs. 73,675 in India. It is available in 4 variants and 7 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 77,175. The Fascino 125 is powered by 125cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 8.04 bhp and a torque of 9.7 Nm. With both front and rear drum brakes, Yamaha Fascino 125 comes up with combined braking system of both wheels. This Fascino 125 scooter weighs 99 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 5.2 liters.
                      The quality of paint on Yamaha Fascino 125 is good throughout and so is the quality of the black plastics and chrome. The front end is now angular and the headlamp gets a unique, concave shape. The tail section looks bolder - thanks to the stretched tail lamp. The midsection has a sloping design which has eaten its way into the floorboard space resulting in a very uncomfortable foot positioning. As a result, there is very little space to move around. Moreover, the suspension setup at both ends on the Fascino 125 feels stiff at low speeds when riding solo but it is the most pliant overall when riding with a pillion. Adding to it is the plush seat that feels comfortable even on long hauls. As for storage, this scooter comes with 21-litre under-seat capacity.
                      
                       Performance

                        This new 125cc fuel-injected engine is fortified by Yamaha’s Blue Core technology. The motor comes with a silent starter & feels smooth right from the moment it is cranked up. The engine’s 8bhp and 9.7Nm figures might not be the highest in the class, but the Fascino’s trump card is its weight. Tipping the scale at a mere 99kg, the Yamaha Fascino 125 is a whole 18kg lesser than the TVS Ntorq 125. Hence, it results in feeling peppy and raring to go even when twisting the throttle at 50kmph. While the handling is good enough, it somewhat seems disconnected when turning in. Nevertheless, the brakes on the scooter offer good bite and feedback even after continuous use.
